WHERE
    total_sale > 1000;
    
-- Q.6 Write a SQL query to find the total number of transactions (transaction_id) made by each gender in each category.

SELECT 
    category, gender, COUNT(*) AS total_trans
FROM
    sql_portfolio_project.retail_sales
GROUP BY category , gender
ORDER BY 1;

WITH hourly_sale
AS
(
SELECT *,
    CASE
        WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM sale_time) < 12 THEN 'Morning'
        WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM sale_time) BETWEEN 12 AND 17 THEN 'Afternoon'
        ELSE 'Evening'
    END as shift
FROM sql_portfolio_project.retail_sales
